## 👾 About Me

Hey! I’m a high school student with a relentless passion for automation. If there’s a task I find repetitive or boring, you can bet I’m already thinking about how to automate it! From small daily chores to big processes, I love finding ways to make things run smoother and save time—because why do something manually when you can make a computer do it for you?

## 🛠️ What I Do

- I’m always learning and experimenting with new ways to automate the world around me.
- My projects are all about making life easier, more efficient, and a little bit cooler.
- I might not have a favorite programming language or tech stack yet, but I’m excited to try everything and find what I love!

## 🌟 Fun Fact

My whole life feels like one big automation project—if it can be automated, I’m interested!
